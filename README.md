# react-d3-wafermap

React component that uses [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to generate a very basic wafermap. The D3 code can be forked on Observable [here](https://observablehq.com/@sdfordham/simple-wafermap). A class-based component is in another branch. This repo was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
